# GuessingGame

GuessingGame is a simple addictive game.
The rules of this game are simple and strict, you can choose a starting number of the range and an ending number of it and Maximum number of guesses.
You will start your guesses and then i added some help for you, (the number is too low or too high) and if you would like a hint i got ya,
I know many players are too proud to get a hint and i respect that but i added a Hint anyways for you each round you get it wrong so do not worry, i got your back if it became risky and close to losing. ;)
When you win or lose you get the choice to play again (yes/no)
